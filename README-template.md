### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about responsiveness and how mobile-first workflow makes it easier. We basically make the mobile first interface first and as the device width increases, we keep introducing those complexities. This is said to overall result in less code, which, is always a good thing in terms of developer experience, maintenance, and efficiency.

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on mobile-first development.

### Useful resources

The w3schools article on css variables helped me with a quick revision on how to declare and use variables in vanilla css.
